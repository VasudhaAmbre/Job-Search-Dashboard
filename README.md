# Job Search Dashboard (SRE / DevOps / Cloud / Apigee)

A single-page dashboard with clickable Google searches across 25+ ATS and top job boards.
Observability keywords are merged into SRE/DevOps/Cloud queries for broader coverage.

## 🚀 Quick Start (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new **public** repo on GitHub (e.g., `job-search-dashboard`).
2. Upload these files (or push via git).
3. In **Settings → Pages**, set:
   - **Source:** `Deploy from a branch`
   - **Branch:** `main` (or `master`), folder: `/ (root)`
4. Save. Your site will be live at: `https://<your-username>.github.io/job-search-dashboard/`

## 🛠️ Local Preview
Just open `index.html` in your browser.

## ✏️ Customize
- To add keywords (e.g., "remote", "H1B", "sponsorship"), edit the queries inside `index.html` and re-deploy.
- For a custom domain, add a `CNAME` file with your domain (e.g., `jobs.yourdomain.com`) and point DNS (CNAME) to `<your-username>.github.io`.
